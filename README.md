## About

The repository contains everything we did *(and more)* during courses I gave to the 2nd year students at HETIC *(20/11 & 27/11/2015)*. It was mainly a *big* introduction to JavaScript. We talked about **Node.js**, **ES2015**, **Babel**, **webpack**, **APIs** and lots of related topics.

The 3 branches are quite differents:
- `master` contains the "final version" of what we tried to develop. The main files are `./server.js`, `./public/src/js/app.js` and `./lib/*.js`.
- `g1` & `g2` contains what we achieved during the classes. It's obviously less ambitious than `master`.

*Note: this project is not about **real world** code. It's just some concepts about JS/Node.js.*
